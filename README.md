# project-A

the name of this project: "PPG Signal Acquisition and Analysis"

thanks to:
Hadas Ofir project manager from SIPL at Technion Israel Institute of Technology.
Hassan Khalil my project partner.

The purpose of the project is to build a future infrastructure for a laboratory on PPG signals.
The way to accomplish this goal was to carry out a literature survey in order to understand what the PPG signal is.
we were asked to find several ways to purchase the PPG signal.
several ways to analyze the signal to extract information.
finally to perform an analysis of all the ways in order to draw conclusions.
in addition we were asked to find several databases and create More additional databases with the help of the acquisition methods we discovered in the laboratory.

We were indeed able to find 4 different methods for extracting heart rate from raw PPG signals.
we found 3 different acquisition methods that are possible to perform in the laboratory and for each one we created its own database.
in addition to all of this we found 2 additional databases that included PPG signals with a pulse reference signal,
these signals varied in terms of physical activity during the measurement.
